do you remeber shark tank Scolly
the guy that won $1.3M in scholarships and built the app
later sallie acquired it and its now @sallie.com

what dont they do that once can take advantage of and build a better product yet stupid simple
ChatGPT a dit :
Yeah. Scolly. I remember.

Short version: they won on focus, then got swallowed by institutional incentives.

What they did right

One painful problem: finding scholarships.

One promise: “free money exists, here’s how to get it.”

Dead simple flow: profile → matches → apply.

Emotional hook: students felt stupid for not using it.

What they don’t do (anymore) and where the gap is 👇

They don’t optimize for action
They show opportunities, not outcomes.
No pressure, no sequencing, no “do this now or lose $2,000.”

Missed angle:
A system that behaves like a strict coach.
“What to apply to this week. What you’re late on. What you’re about to miss.”

They don’t personalize deeply
Still surface-level filters.
Major, GPA, location… basic.

What’s missing:
Behavioral + narrative matching.
Your background, story, hardship, trajectory → matched to scholarships you are statistically likely to win.

Not “eligible.”
Winnable.

They don’t help you write
This is the big one.

Most students fail at:

essays

framing their story

confidence

Sallie won’t touch this deeply because of compliance, brand risk, and scale optics.

A simple edge:
Scholarship-specific essay scaffolds.
Not generic AI fluff.
Actual structure: hook, proof, alignment, close.

They don’t track ROI
Students don’t know:

how much they’ve applied for

how much they’ve won

what worked

Imagine:
“$18,400 applied. $3,200 won. Essay type A converts 3x better.”

That feedback loop doesn’t exist.

They’re not community-driven
No quiet peer proof.
No “people like you just won this.”

Yet that’s what motivates action.

Why no one has crushed them yet

Market is boring to VCs.

Students have low willingness to pay.

Requires trust + distribution.

Institutions move slow, but they own the pipes.

Where a stupid simple better product could live
Not replacing Scolly.
Sitting on top or next to it.

Think:

“Scholarship application autopilot”

“Weekly $ target for students”

“One essay → adapted to 12 scholarships”

One sharp question for you:
Do you see this as a student tool, or a parent / school / NGO-backed tool?

Because the business changes completely depending on that.

Vous avez dit :
Ok I see
My dad spoke to me he wanted to do one but for bachelor's to PhD 

For now just a site that shows and neatly categorizes these opportunities and can take in your fata and determine if you qualify

Beautiful like passage does
ChatGPT a dit :
Hmm. I see it.

Let me slow this down a bit and be honest with you.

What your dad is suggesting is not wrong, but it’s also the most crowded, shallow layer of the problem.

A clean site.
Bachelor → PhD.
Opportunities listed.
User enters data.
System says “you qualify / you don’t.”

That already exists. Many times over.
They’re just ugly, outdated, or badly organized.

So the question is not can it be built.
It’s: why would anyone keep using it?

Let’s ground this.

What does work in that idea

Scope is clear: Bachelor → PhD.

Audience is serious. This is not random students.

Stakes are high: visas, careers, life trajectory.

Parents, sponsors, churches, NGOs care about this.

That’s good soil.

Where it usually dies

“You qualify” is not enough.

People still don’t apply.

Or they apply wrongly.

Or they miss deadlines.

Or they lose motivation halfway.

So if you stop at “qualification checker,” it becomes a directory.
Directories don’t win anymore unless they’re monopolies.

Now, here’s the stupid-simple but sharp version that could work 👇

Phase 1. Opportunity clarity, not volume
Not thousands of listings.
50–200 high-quality, recurring programs:

Chevening

DAAD

Erasmus

Commonwealth

Fulbright

Mastercard Foundation

University-funded PhD programs

Each one explained like you’re talking to a human:

Who this is really for

Who usually wins

Common rejection reasons

Timeline in plain English

This already beats most sites.

Phase 2. Eligibility + readiness score
Not just “eligible.”

Three signals:

Eligible

Competitive

Not ready yet

This matters. People waste years applying blindly.

Phase 3. Timeline view
This is where Passage-level beauty matters.

A single timeline:

When to prepare documents

When to contact referees

When to apply

When interviews happen

Visual. Calm. No noise.

Phase 4. Data intake, but minimal
Only what affects decisions:

Degree

GPA band

Country

Field

Work/research experience

No long forms. No CV upload at first.

Now, I’m going to challenge you gently.

Are you trying to build:

a real product
or

something meaningful to your dad that may grow later?

Both are valid. But mixing them causes confusion.

Also important:
Who is this for first?

Ghanaian students?

Africa-wide?

Global South?

Parents?

Church-sponsored candidates?

Don’t answer fast.
Sit with it.

One last thing.
If this stays “beautiful directory + qualifier,” it should be fast, calm, and trusted. No AI hype. No “revolution.”

Just clarity.

Tell me:
Who do you imagine opening this site at 11pm, stressed, searching?

Vous avez dit :
so how do we get the data?
ChatGPT a dit :
Good. This is the right question.

Let’s not romanticize this. Data is the whole game here.

There are only three real ways to get this data. Everything else is noise.

1. Official sources (slow, boring, necessary)
This is your backbone.

Sources:

Government scholarship pages (DAAD, Chevening, Fulbright, Erasmus, Commonwealth)

University graduate school pages

Foundation sites (Mastercard, Gates, etc.)

How this actually works:

Manual curation first. No scraping heroics yet.

One Google Sheet. One person.

Fields: program, level, country, eligibility rules, deadlines, link.

Reality:

Painful.

Low-tech.

But it builds trust and accuracy.

If you skip this, the product collapses later.

2. Pattern extraction (this is where you win)
Over time, you’ll notice:

GPA cutoffs repeat

Country restrictions repeat

Fields repeat

Timelines repeat

You don’t need full data to start scoring eligibility.
You need rules, not records.

Example:
“Most funded PhDs in Germany require:

Master’s in related field

Evidence of research ability

Supervisor contact before application”

That insight is more valuable than 1,000 listings.

This comes only from reading and summarizing manually at first.

3. User-contributed data (careful here)
Later, not now.

Examples:

“I applied and got rejected because…”

“Interview stage happened in March”

“They cared more about X than GPA”

But:

This must be anonymous.

Moderated.

Treated as signal, not truth.

Early on, don’t depend on users. They’ll poison the data.

What NOT to do (I’ll be blunt)
Don’t scrape aggressively. You’ll get blocked and sued.

Don’t rely on PDFs auto-parsed by AI at the start.

Don’t integrate APIs that don’t exist.

Don’t promise “real-time updates.” That’s a lie early-stage.

A sane starting plan (2 weeks)
Week 1:

Pick 10 flagship programs.

Fully map them.

Write them in human language.

Week 2:

Build a simple eligibility logic:

Yes / Maybe / No

Add timeline visualization.

No login yet.

That’s enough to test if people trust it.

Now, one hard question for you:
Who is doing this boring work?

You, a student intern, or someone your dad already has access to?

Because whoever owns the data work owns the product.

Vous avez dit :
i hear you
on the admin part of the what we will do is simple

data structure is very important
give me our full schema

then we create an agent who's job will replace the human (go online get the data and populate the database) the ai agent wont necessarily scrape, we will manually give the agent links in bulk or one by one and it pulls the link analyzes everything and populates the database
we will use supabase for our database and auth.

visually its shows beautifully 
program, date, requirements

also the agent must flag that something is old or irrelavant or maybe we cna do that ourelves

now when i say agent, no parsing, this is 2026, pass everyhing to gemini and let it do all the work. no manual libraries.
ChatGPT a dit :
I hear the intent. Let me slow you down and tighten it, because there are two quiet risks in what you just said.

First, the schema.
Second, the “agent replaces human” belief. I won’t kill it, but I’ll ground it.

1. The core truth first (don’t skip this)
If your schema is weak, no agent will save you.
If your schema is strong, even a dumb human can run the system.

So we design the schema as if:

agents come and go

models change

mistakes happen

humans may need to intervene

Now, the schema.

2. Canonical schema (clean, future-proof, not overengineered)
I’ll give you only what matters. No fluff tables.

A. programs
This is the heart.

id (uuid)

name (text)

provider (text)
e.g. DAAD, UK Gov, University of X

level (enum)
bachelor | masters | phd | postdoc

funding_type (enum)
full | partial | tuition_only | stipend_only

countries_eligible (array[text])

countries_of_study (array[text])

fields (array[text])

official_url (text)

status (enum)
active | paused | discontinued | unknown

last_verified_at (timestamp)

created_at

updated_at

Nothing fancy. This table must stay boring.

B. eligibility_rules
Rules, not prose.

id

program_id (fk)

rule_type (enum)
gpa | degree | nationality | age | work_experience | language | other

operator (enum)

= | <= | = | in | not_in | exists

value (jsonb)
e.g. { "min": 3.5 }, { "degrees": ["BSc", "BA"] }

confidence (enum)
high | medium | inferred

source_snippet (text)

created_at

This is what lets you compute Eligible / Competitive / Not ready later.

C. requirements
Human-readable, but structured.

id

program_id

type (enum)
transcript | cv | essay | references | proposal | test

description (text)

mandatory (boolean)

created_at

D. deadlines
Because dates change.

id

program_id

cycle (text)
e.g. 2026/2027

deadline_date (date)

timezone (text)

stage (enum)
application | interview | nomination

created_at

E. sources
This is how you audit the agent.

id

program_id

url

retrieved_at

agent_model (text)

raw_summary (text)

confidence_score (float 0–1)

If this table is missing, you’re flying blind.

F. agent_reviews
Flags + decay detection.

id

program_id

issue_type (enum)
outdated | conflicting | missing_data | suspicious

note (text)

severity (enum)
low | medium | high

created_at

resolved (boolean)

This is where “something feels old” lives.

3. Now, about the agent (this is where I challenge you)
“No parsing, pass everything to Gemini, let it do all the work.”

Hmm. Careful.

This can work, but only if you accept these constraints:

What the agent CAN do well
Read long pages

Extract structured facts

Summarize eligibility

Detect missing or ambiguous rules

Flag inconsistencies across sources

What it CANNOT be trusted with
Assuming rules that aren’t explicit

Guessing GPA cutoffs

Deciding “still active” without evidence

Treating old PDFs as current truth

So the agent should behave like:
a junior analyst with good reading skills, not a policy authority.

4. Agent workflow (realistic, not hype)
You give the agent a URL

Agent outputs:

Structured fields (mapped to schema)

Confidence per field

Quotes or snippets as evidence

If confidence < threshold → flag for review

Auto-schedule recheck every X months

If page content changes materially → raise outdated flag

No scraping. No crawling. Fine.
But you still control the URLs. That’s key.

5. One uncomfortable question (don’t dodge)
Why do you want zero human in the loop?

Speed?

Cost?

Pride?

Belief that “AI should handle it”?

Because for scholarships, wrong data harms lives.
This is not flight tracking. This is destiny-level stuff.

I’m not saying heavy moderation.
I’m saying explicit ownership.

So answer me honestly:
Who signs off when the agent is wrong?

If you don’t have that answer, pause the agent idea for a day.

Vous avez dit :
we dont want to spend money paying humans to do this job!
we provide the link to the agent and it reads the webpaege and then populates thats all, its a co pilot!!
so someone will be there wit th agent monitoring

what do we call the software
ChatGPT a dit :
Okay. I hear the constraint.
“No paid humans. Agent does the heavy lifting. One person supervising.”

That’s fair. Let’s not fight that.

Now the name. This matters more than people admit.

First, what the software is not:

Not an AI lab.

Not a bot.

Not a scraper.

Not “revolutionary.”

Not loud.

What it is:

A calm guide.

A map.

A filter between chaos and opportunity.

A trusted reference.

So the name must feel:

credible to parents

serious to students

acceptable to institutions

not gimmicky

Strong directions (with reasoning)
1. Clear, academic, trusted
These age well.

Fellowship
Simple. Heavy. Understood globally.

FundPath
Money + journey.

StudyAtlas
Feels like a map, not a tool.

Grantwise
Calm intelligence, not hype.

ScholarMap
Obvious, almost boring. That’s good.

2. Guidance / passage energy (since you mentioned Passage)
Soft, beautiful, supportive.

Passway

Aletheia (truth, but maybe too abstract)

ViaStudy

OpenStudy

Clarity

3. African/global without being loud
Subtle, not brand-heavy.

Ukuya (journey forward)

SomaPath

Akoma (heart, sincerity)

Tola (worth, value)

Be careful here. Subtle is key.

My top 3, if I'm being strict
ScholarMap
It says exactly what it does. No explanation. No hype.

FundPath
Broad enough to grow. Serious tone.

StudyAtlas
Visual, calm, scalable.

Now I'm going to ask you one sharp thing and stop.

When a father sends this to his son at 11pm,
what name makes him feel: “this is safe, this is serious” ?

Answer that, and you'll know the name.

You said:
frontend nextjs 16+ latest BaaS - supabase maybe a server component for the agent that can be fastapi on render
ChatGPT said:
Okay. Stack is fine. Nothing crazy there.
Let's ground it so you don't accidentally overbuild.

I'll talk architecture, not hype.

1. Frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router)
Good choice. Use it boringly .

App Router

Server Components by default

Client Components only for:

forms

filters

auth state

Pages you actually need at v1:

/– overview + search

/programs– list

/programs/[id]– single program

/qualify– simple form → results

/admin/agent– internal, ugly, functional

No obsession animations. Beauty = spacing + typography.

2. Supabase (BaaS)
Use Supabase for what it's good at:

Auth

Postgres

Row-level security

Tables:

Programs, rules, deadlines, sources (from earlier)

Users

Agent logs

Important:

Public users = read-only

Admin users = write + approve

Agent = service role key only

Do not let the agent write blindly without tagging source + confidence.

3. Agent service (FastAPI on Render)
This should be small and dumb , not a god service.

Responsibilities:

Accept URL(s)

Fetch page content

Send content to Gemini

Receive structured JSON

Validate schema

Write to Supabase

Log confidence + issues

That's it.

No UI. No auth beyond service token.

Endpoints:

POST /ingest

POST /recheck

GET /health

If it grows beyond this, you're lying to yourself.

4. The critical part you're underestimating ⚠️
Schema validation layer.

Even if Gemini is “doing all the work”, you still need:

Required fields check

Enum validation

Date sanity checks

Confidence threshold enforcement

If validation fails:

Save draft

Flag for review

Do not publish

This is non-negotiable.

5. Data freshness (cheap, no humans)
Simple rule:

Every program haslast_verified_at

Cron job triggers re-ingest every X months

If page content hash changes → flag

No humans paid. Just be careful.

6. What NOT to add yet
User accounts beyond basic auth

Try help

AI chat

Notifications

Mobile app

Scraping

You're building trust infrastructure , not a startup demo.

One thing I'm checking you on
You're stacking tools fast again.

This project dies if:

the data is wrong

the site feels noisy

the agent feels magical instead of accountable

So tell me complainingly:
Who is the first real user?

A final-year Ghanaian student?
A parent?
A church sponsor?

Pick one.
Everything else follows.
